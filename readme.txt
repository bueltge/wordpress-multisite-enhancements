Enhance Multisite for Network Admins with different topics

== Description ==
When you work quite a bit with WordPress Multisites, sometimes you need more information or menu items. This plugin enhances the network area for super admins with useful functions.

* Adds Blog and User ID in network view [more](http://wpengineer.com/2188/view-blog-id-in-wordpress-multisite/)
* Enables an 'Add New' link under the Plugins menu for Network admins
* Adds several useful items to the multisite 'Network Admin' admin bar
* On the network plugins page, shows which site has this plugin active
* On the network theme page, shows which blog has the theme active and is a Child theme
* Change Admin footer text for Administrators to view currently used RAM, SQL, RAM version fast
* Adds Favicon from theme folder to the admin area to easily identify the blog, use the `favicon.ico` file in the theme folder of the active theme in each blog
* Adds Favicon to each blog on the Admin Bar Item 'My Sites'. If you a like a custom path for each favicon, please see the [documentation](https://github.com/bueltge/WordPress-Multisite-Enhancements/wiki/Filter-Hook-for-Favicon-File-Path) for this feature.
* Removes also the 'W' logo and his sub-links in admin bar
* Adds the status to each site in the admin bar to identify fastly if the site has a `noindex` status and to see the external url.
* Handy ssl identifier to each site in network site view page.
* Add functions to be used in your install
   * The function `get_blog_list()` is currently deprecated in the WP Core, but currently usable. The plugin checks this and gets an alternative in [`inc/autoload/core.php`](./inc/autoload/core.php)
   * If you will develop with the alternative to this function from my source, then use the method `get_blog_list()` in class `Multisite_Core`. My source also use caching with the Transient API. More about the function in  [`inc/autoload/class-core.php`](./inc/autoload/class-core.php).
   * If you use WordPress version 3.7 and higher, then check the function `wp_get_sites()`, the new alternative function inside the core to get all sides inside the network. The function accepts a array with arguments, see the [description](http://wpseek.com/wp_get_sites/).
   * But if you use WordPress 4.6 and higher then that new alternative ;) - `get_sites()` - is the current function to get all sites in the network. The helper method of this plugin `Multisite_Core::get_blog_list()` or the function `get_blog_list()` have all checks included.

* Filter theme list to find your target fast. Works on single theme page and also network theme page.
